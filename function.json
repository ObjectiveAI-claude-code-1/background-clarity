The image may depict any setting — a studio backdrop, a sunlit windowsill, a cluttered kitchen counter, a garden, or a city sidewalk. The function examines the entire frame as a system of visual relationships, with the cat as the anchor, evaluating the background across three qualities: visual stillness (freedom from clutter, busy patterns, visible text, and competing objects), tonal harmony (whether colors, brightness, and contrast complement rather than overwhelm the cat), and compositional deference (whether the spatial arrangement of background elements directs the viewer's eye toward the cat rather than away from it)."
