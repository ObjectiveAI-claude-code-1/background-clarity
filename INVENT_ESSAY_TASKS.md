1. Assess the visual stillness of the background by examining how much the space behind and around the cat generates its own demand for attention. Look for elements that act as individual magnets for the eye — physical clutter such as tangled cords, scattered objects, stacked boxes, and assorted packaging; busy patterns like bold wallpaper or high-contrast textures; strong geometric lines that cut across the frame; bright or heavily saturated color patches; and above all, visible legible text on packaging, signs, book covers, or screens, which pulls the human eye almost involuntarily. A background does not need to be empty to be visually still — a bookshelf of uniformly colored spines or a garden of soft repeating greenery can be perfectly calm — but its elements must blend into a cohesive, quiet visual texture rather than asserting themselves as distinct points of interest. The task is to determine whether the background hums with competing signals or settles into a low-frequency rhythm that lets the cat remain the loudest thing in the frame.

2. Evaluate the tonal harmony between the background and the cat by examining whether the colors, brightness, and contrast of the surrounding space complement the subject or compete with it. Consider whether the background's palette and luminance allow the cat to maintain clear visual separation and primacy: soft, muted tones that sit comfortably behind the cat tend to support it, while neon-bright walls, harsh lighting hot spots, patches of saturated color unrelated to the cat's fur, and extreme contrast jumps create tonal rivalry. Look for whether the background's colors echo or complement the cat — warm wood tones behind an orange tabby, cool grays behind a gray cat — or whether they clash and overpower. Also account for the presence of other animals or partial figures in the frame — a second cat at the edge, a dog's nose intruding from the corner, a person's hand reaching in — as these introduce competing tonal and structural elements that fracture the viewer's sense of a single clear subject, leaving attention unresolved.

3. Judge the compositional deference of the background by examining whether the spatial arrangement of elements in the surrounding space directs the viewer's eye toward the cat or pulls it away. Look for signs that the background serves the subject: leading lines such as the edge of a couch or the converging lines of a hallway that point toward the cat, depth-of-field blur that keeps the cat sharp while softening everything behind it, and natural framing elements like doorways, archways, or the curve of a blanket that enclose the cat within a visual boundary. Conversely, look for centrifugal forces that work against the cat: strong lines that lead off the edge of the frame, bright windows or light sources positioned away from the subject that draw attention to the periphery, and background elements arranged with their own internal logic — a neatly organized shelf, a deliberate row of plants — that constitute a secondary composition competing with the cat for structural dominance. The task is to determine whether the background knows its role as supporting cast or whether it has assembled itself into an ensemble that rivals the subject.
