Evaluate how clean and distraction-free the background and surrounding space are in relation to the cat. Determine whether the non-subject elements in the photograph recede to let the cat command attention or compete with the cat for the viewer's eye. A clean background is not necessarily an empty one; it is one where the visual information behind and around the cat supports the cat's presence rather than fragmenting it. Penalize backgrounds that pile up visual noise and pull focus away from the subject: cluttered objects, competing colors and busy patterns, visible text on packaging, other animals partially in frame, and bright or attention-grabbing elements that rival the cat. Reward backgrounds that settle the eye naturally on the cat, whether that background is a simple painted wall, soft garden greenery, or a lived-in space with a calm visual rhythm. The question is whether the space around the cat acts as a setting that supports the subject or a rival that dilutes it.
